# Arrays
practice problems

A few codes based on arrays, that I did while learning :)

1--Subarray.cpp: Given an unsorted array A of size N of non-negative integers, find a continuous sub-array which adds to a given number S.

I have tried to use Window Sliding technique to make this code more efficient.
