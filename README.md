# Arrays
practice problems

A few codes based on arrays, that I did while learning :)

1--Subarray.cpp: Given an unsorted array A of size N of non-negative integers, find a continuous sub-array which adds to a given number S.

I have tried to use Window Sliding technique to make this code more efficient.

2--Leaders.cpp
Given an array of positive integers. Your task is to find the leaders in the array.
Note: An element of array is leader if it is greater than or equal to all the elements to its right side. Also, the rightmost element is always a leader.
